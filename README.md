# Macho Hacks 1st place, Jul 2018:
This project was built for the MachoHacks hackathon. With around 20 teams pitching their ideas by the end of the weekend we were selected as first place by the judges and by the peoples choice award.

#Usecase:
This project was built to demonstrate the working process from begining to end of a organic supply chain where the farmers can input informations about their crops, how it's grown, who is transporting it to the manufacturer...
On the other end, the users can interact with a chatbot that collects the questions asked and filters answers.
Both the chatbot and the farmer side are uploaded to the blockchain and become immutable

# Developent technologies:
This repo contains part of the technologies developed on the weekend. The farmer interaction side.
For this repor we used Solidity, Javascript, Jquery, Web3, Ganache, Truffle, HTML5, CSS.

# Javascript:
Javascript is used to connect the contract with the network. The file deploy.js contains the deployment code and filters the information we want to input t our smart contract.

# General execution information:
General execution information can be foind on the instructions.doc file. It contains the ways to interact with the contract on the CLI and node's used on the project.

# The bot:
You can find our interactive bot on my team-mate's repo.
